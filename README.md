TODO: 


As far as the development project, we can think of it as three parts:
Web hook end point (HTTPS) for accepting the decisions from Veriff into your database
iOS SDK integration into your app
Android SDK integration into your app
Please let me know the contact info of your developer, and I can start sending materials for the technical integration!
